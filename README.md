Design

"B1" Allows global style reset by tag selector for <h1>...<h6>, <p> and <ul> elements.

"B2" The elements do not have external indents (margin property), which "punch" the parent element.

"B3" In one-line collections of elements, the extreme left or right margin of the elements (if any) is cleared.

"B4" The margin property is used for indents between two adjacent elements.

"B5" The padding property is used for the space between the border of the parent and its child.

"B6" The dimensions of external indents (margin property) and internal fields (padding property) of the elements are set exactly according to the layout.

"B7" Created a generic auxiliary class .container for centering and limiting content by width.

"B8" The width of the "container" corresponds to the layout and is equal to 1200px.

"B9" "Container" wraps the content of the header, footer and sections. That is, it is inside them.

"B10" Flexbox is used to position elements, but only where necessary. For example, in the header, navigation, lists in sections, etc., that is, where it is impossible to arrange elements horizontally in any other way.

"B11" The final sizes of the blocks in the browser correspond to the layout.

"B12" Elements do not have a fixed height, it is determined by their content.

"B13" The header has a bottom frame, you need to zoom in a lot to see it.

"B14" Sections are arranged one under the other like a stack of books, without external indents.

"B15" One .section class is used for all sections, upper and lower paddings of 94px are set, which push the content inside the section.

"B16" The technique described in the synopsis and the video workshop is used to construct the grids.

"B17" Cards on the Portfolio page have a border (border property), but only at the bottom of the card.
